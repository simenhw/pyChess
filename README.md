# pyChess
This project was made by me as a hobby project for the purpose of learning and getting a deeper understanding of Python(Py3)
in addition to the challenge of working out the logic.
The choice to create the game of chess was made on the level of complexity, and the natural expandability.

List of progress:
* Making the logic (playable with console/terminal) -DONE
* Adding graphics - IN PROGRESS
  -Needs a menu for start / restart etc.
  -Needs a win/loose/draw screen/box
  -Needs a graphical interface to promote pawns
  -Could need a "flip screen" function
* Expanding game - maybe TBD
  -Adding a clock/timer
  -Making game playable online
* PGN export - TBD
* PGN import - TBD
* Neural network! - Yeah... TBD
